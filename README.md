Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries! This simple Python script helps you calculate the cost of your pizza order based on your choices. 
Follow the instructions below to understand how the code works and how you can use it.

This script takes user inputs for pizza size, pepperoni addition, and extra cheese, then calculates the final bill based on the selections. 
The pricing model is as follows:
  
 - Small Pizza: $15
 - Add Pepperoni: +$2
 - Medium Pizza: $20
 - Add Pepperoni: +$3
 - Large Pizza: $25
 - Add Pepperoni: +$3
 - Extra Cheese (any size): +$1


This code is my second code, and I wrote it during a lecture. It demonstrates basic control flow, user input handling, and simple arithmetic operations in Python.
